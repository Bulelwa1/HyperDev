# TODO

- project search: /projects/search/:query
- category pages
- limit number of results per category on the front page

- cleanup based on coffee/styl starter (+ browserify?)

- better design (scales out to categories, less visually bland, increased project meta)

- update header so that go to editor doesn't look like the main cta (instead the primary goal of the site is project selection and exploration)

- ?Caching, so I'm not hitting the db a bunch of times on each request
- user pages
- likes and remix counts

- search box for searchin' against api
  - search result pages
