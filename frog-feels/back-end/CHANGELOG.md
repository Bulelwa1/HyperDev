- /last-week capability: generate/send email button

May 19, 2016

- when you send your email, show an inprogress state
- create `/last-week` route , that lists out drawings (grouped by feelings)
- /last-week capability: 'reject' drawing
- fix async issues. A Promise-r is me.

- 'feels' color is active color
- prevent blank submisssions (don't do anything on submit click if canvas is unchnaged / or all black||null)
- funner to click colors: using transitions
- bought frogfeels.com
